    "patcher-instructions-usage-step-3": "Click $t(button-firmware-patch) to generate the firmware. Check the console for errors and firmware size. If the firmware is too large, you will need to remove mods that add size.",
    "patcher-instructions-usage-step-4": "You can now save the firmware file. It is compatible with the official updater tool. If you are using a compatible web browser, you can also flash it directly. Refer to the flashing instructions below.",

    "flasher-description-1": "Modern Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome, Edge, and Opera have a built-in API that allows UVMOD to flash the firmware directly to the radio. This is the easiest way to flash the firmware, but it only works on Windows and Linux.",
    "flasher-description-2": "On Windows, you need the driver for the programming cable. Typically these cables use ch340, ch341 or cp210x chips. On linux, the driver is usually included.",
    "flasher-instructions-step-1": "Connect the programming cable to your computer and ensure the proper drivers are installed. It should show up as a com port.",
    "flasher-instructions-step-2": "On your radio (still disconnected and turned off), hold down PTT (large button on the side) and turn on the radio while still holding PTT. Now the flashlight should turn on while the rest of the radio stays dark. Your radio is now in bootloader mode.",
